Museum Energy-Saving Ontology

The aim of the ontology is to represent the knowledge related to BEMS's trustworthy IoT entities deployed in museums. The specific objectives of the ontology are: a) to represent the knowledge related to the trustworthy IoT entities that 'live' in a museum, i.e., things (e.g., artworks, spaces), sensors, actuators, people, data, applications; b) to deal with the semantic interoperability and integration of "smart" museum applications and data in general; c) to represent knowledge related to energy saving; d) represent knowledge related to museum visits and visitors towards enhancing visiting experience and preserve comfort; e) represent knowledge related to the monitoring of environmental conditions towards protecting and preserving museum artwork.
